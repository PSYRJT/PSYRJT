- 👋 Good day, I'm @PSYRJT, also known as Sai Rijit.
- 👀 I’m interested in... not much. I like nice aesthetically pleasing User Interfaces (UI), eargasmic Sound Design and anime... Steins;Gate and stuff yeah.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... to organize my life, get over my social anxiety, new skills and studying with passion.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... anything that can make me some money, while we have a good time.
- 📫 How to reach me? Don't reach out to me, I probably will ghost you but if I'm feeling talkative, I won't shut up for a while and completely reveal all my darkest secrets.

--> To Be Continued... (iS tHaT a moTh****** JoJo rEfeR- *crewmatedeath.ogg*)
